**Local Weather**

Don't run using Mozilla Firefox because it could not work because of it's bug with 
detecting geolocation (see https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/does-firefox-share-my-location-websites).
Especially I had troubles with this browser during developing. 
I advise to use Google Chrome while running it.
~~But I do not advise to use Chrome in other occasions:)~~

This weather web-service use your geolocation through geolocation.Navigator to get weather from http://openweathermap.org using it's API.
It informs about type of weather (cloudy, sunny, rain, etc...), temperature, 'feels like' temperature, wind speed and humidity.
It also changes background image and weather icon which depends on type of weather. 
Furthermore it can advise you type of clothes to wear which depends on temperature, type of weather, humidity.
